My name is *Alberto Averna*, I am a passionate scientist and neuroengineer from Italy. During my PhD, that I conducted at both the [Italian Institute of Technology in Genova (Italy)](https://www.iit.it/it/) and the [Kansas University Medical Center (USA)](https://www.kumc.edu), I contributed to the developement of closed-loop brain stimulation strategies for the rehabilitation of motor deficits after brain injuries in animal models. 
Following the completion of my PhD, I started my first postdoc at the [University of Milan (Italy)](https://www.diss.unimi.it/ecm/home/ricerca/centri-di-ricerca) where I could expand my research line to human neuroscience, specifically to basal ganglia neurophysiology in patients with Parkinson's disease and Dystonia. 
In 01/2022 I joint Dr. Gerd Tinkhauser's research team as senior postdoc where we work on the development, clinical translation, and evaluation of innovative approaches to optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) for movement disorders.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
